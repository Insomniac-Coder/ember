# The job for the memory-model rework (owner, 2026-10-24)

The first phase 3 missed this: it replaced compile-time checking with run-time checks, so every
design came out slower than C and still not safe. This is the job as the owner set it.

## The goals, all at once

1. **Speed on par with C and Rust.**
2. **Memory safety the same as Rust's, or better.**
3. **Python-like: easy to read and easy to write.**

Rust already shows that 1 and 2 can be had together, with all the checking done when the program is
compiled and nothing paid while it runs. What makes Rust annoying is how it makes you write things
to satisfy its rules, not the safety itself.

## For each annoying part of Rust, three acceptable answers

1. **A Pythonic way of writing what Rust does:** the same compile-time guarantee, written the way a
   Python programmer would write it naturally.
2. **A smarter compile-time solution** to the problem Rust's rule addresses, so the rule is not needed.
3. **A new way to address the same problem** (owner, 2026-10-24: "I am not opposed to the idea of
   workflow finding a new way to address the same problem as long as it's clever, easy to read/write
   and is on par with C/Rust in terms of speed while maintaining same or better memory safety"), which
   may be a different mechanism, as long as it is:
   - clever,
   - easy to read and write,
   - on par with C and Rust in speed,
   - the same or better than Rust in memory safety.

## Before anything counts as failed: try to save it

Owner, 2026-10-24: "before considering anything as a failure, a question needs to be asked whether
there is something that can be fixed to make that approach faster, maybe the idea was good but the
implementation was not optimal and if it can't be saved then discard it, if some good parts are found
note them as they might be useful at some point".

When an answer falls short (slower than C or Rust doing the same work, less safe than Rust, or harder
to read or write than the Python version):

1. **Ask whether the idea is good and only the implementation is weak.** Look for what makes it slow
   or unsafe, and try to fix that: a better layout, a check that can be proven away, a cheaper
   mechanism for the same idea. Measure the fixed version.
2. **If it can be saved, keep the saved version**, with its measurements.
3. **If it cannot be saved, discard it**, and say why: the measurement or the counterexample that no
   fix removes.
4. **Note the good parts of a discarded answer.** Anything clever, fast or easy to write in it goes in
   a list of good parts, with where it came from, because it may be useful later.

A failure is never presented as a design choice.
