#! language "0.9.6"
## `std.mem` — low-level memory facilities.
##
## `[UNS-10]` gives `UnsafeCell[T]` this public module identity. Its private
## one-field representation and its two operations are compiler-known during
## Phase 2 so no source code can accidentally expose safe access to `value`.

pub struct UnsafeCell[T]:
    value: T

## `[DRP-1]` — the public, safe spelling for ending a value's life early.
## Taking the value through an `owned` parameter transfers it into this frame;
## ordinary scope-end destruction then runs its destructor exactly once.
pub fn drop[T](owned value: T):
    pass
