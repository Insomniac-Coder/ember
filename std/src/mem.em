## `std.mem` — low-level memory facilities.

## `[UNS-10]` gives `UnsafeCell[T]` this public module identity. Its private
## one-field representation and its two operations are compiler-known during
## Phase 2 so no source code can accidentally expose safe access to `value`.

pub struct UnsafeCell[T]:
    value: T
